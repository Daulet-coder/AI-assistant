# AI-assistant
Your friend and teacher, who gives you step-by-step hints

Abstract
Objective: To develop an AI-agent that not only supports students in completing homework, but also encourages
them to self-study and develop critical thinking skills.
Hypothesis: The assistant platform can improve the academic performance of schoolchildren.
Novelty: a system will be created that gives step-by-step hints
Practical value: This method will help to improve critical thinking, problem-solving ability, and deep understanding
of the topic. This will help maintain a balance between the use of technology and self-development, while reducing
the risks of excessive dependence on AI.


Based on surveys of students and parents, five major issues have been identified with the excessive use of ready-made solutions:
1. Difficulty in understanding educational material (47%)
— Complex topics, rapid curriculum pace, lack of personalized explanations, and fear of asking questions.

2. Low motivation and lack of interest in learning (38%)
— Habitual cheating, absence of a drive for independent study, and reduced engagement with the learning process.

3. Limited access to quality education (34%)
— Restricted access to qualified teachers, shortage of educational resources, and lack of individualized instruction.

4. Emotional isolation and psychological stress (18%)
— Lack of support in challenging situations, difficulties in forming peer relationships, anxiety over academic failure, and internal fears.

5. Ethical and academic issues (12%)
— Frequent cheating fosters incorrect moral values, dependency on others’ work, risk of academic penalties, and loss of critical thinking skills.

What should we do?
It is now clear that to support students in doing homework and understanding material, an AI agent needs to be developed.
Instead of simply providing ready-made answers, this agent—designed as a wrapper—gently guides students by offering hints and tools that encourage independent decision-making.
This approach fosters critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a deeper understanding of the subject matter. It helps maintain a healthy balance between leveraging technology and promoting self-development, while also reducing the risks of overdependence on AI.

Conclusion:
As a result of the project, a unique AI assistant was developed—one that not only helps students complete their homework but also fosters their critical thinking through step-by-step guidance and personalized explanations.
Moreover, this AI goes beyond traditional learning: it provides support, motivation, and a tech-enabled environment that helps children navigate various challenges.
Market analysis revealed a lack of comparable products that combine educational and psychological functions with such depth. This makes the AI assistant a one-of-a-kind solution in the field of digital education—capable of transforming the learning experience and becoming a trusted companion for every student.

System prompt:
You are an AI Assistant for students of all school levels.
Guide students step-by-step without giving direct answers. Start with a general hint to approach the problem. If they need more help, offer progressively detailed steps.
Only if the student is truly stuck, provide the full solution but ensure they understand the process.
Your goal is to instill confidence, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills in students.
Don't give direct answers, just step-by-step key hints. If people don't understand, give another key hint for approach. Just hints, no full solution. 1–2 hints. Also give full theory for their solving. If the language is not mentioned, then Russian is automatically used.
Never give a complete solution or complete code, just hints.
